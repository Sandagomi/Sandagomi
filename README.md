# *Hey Iâ€™m @Sandagomi* ðŸ‘‹ 

## *Bio*ðŸ‘€  
<p style='text-align: justify;'>A passionate and results-driven Technical Product Manager with over 10 years of experience in the IT industry, spanning Product Management, Software Engineering, and Technical Business Analysis. I specialize in driving end-to-end product lifecycle execution from concept to launch, with a strong focus on innovation, scalability, and customer-centric solutions.

I bring a unique blend of technical and strategic thinking, having worked across industries such as Wagering (Racing & Sports Betting), Fintech, Healthcare, Stock Market, and Software Solutions. In recent years, Iâ€™ve also gained hands-on experience with Cloud-based architectures, AI solutions, and Cloud Kitchen platforms, helping organizations unlock new business models and operational efficiencies.

When Iâ€™m not immersed in building impactful digital products, youâ€™ll find me with my guitar, finding inspiration through music.

Iâ€™m always excited to collaborate with visionary teams and contribute my technical insight, analytical mindset, and creative energy to meaningful projects.
